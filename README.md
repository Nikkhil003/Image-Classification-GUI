Image Classification using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)

This project aims to classify images from the CIFAR-10 dataset using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) implemented in TensorFlow. The model achieves a classification accuracy of 92% on the test dataset after training for 50 epochs. Additionally, data augmentation techniques were used to improve model generalization.
