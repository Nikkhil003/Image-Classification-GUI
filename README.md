Image Classification using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)
-
This project aims to classify images from the CIFAR-10 dataset using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) implemented in TensorFlow. The model achieves a classification accuracy of 72% on the test dataset after training for 10 epochs. Additionally, data augmentation techniques were used to improve model generalization.

## Features  
- Image Classification: Classifies images into multiple categories.  
- GUI Interface: Intuitive interface built with Taipy.  
- Image Uploading: Supports image uploads from your system.  
- Real-Time Predictions: Provides instant results.  
- Customizable Models: Easily integrate machine learning models.  
- Visualization: Displays images and classification results in the GUI.
